The workflow in this repository is the Joint Discovery workflow provided
by the Broad Institute, along with a handful of small modifications to allow
the workflow to run more reliably for cohorts of around 4,000 WGS samples.

A copy of the joint-discovery-gatk4.wdl file was made on July 1, 2019
from the Broad's github repo:

https://github.com/gatk-workflows/gatk4-germline-snps-indels/blob/240752418d7a1f64aaaf73ff425e22a45969519f/joint-discovery-gatk4.wdl

and imported into the FireCloud Methods Repository.


A few updates needed to be made to get it running reliably in Terra for AMP PD:

1- Allow for passing a "user_project_id" such that ImportGVCFs can support
requester pays buckets.

2- Add support for maxRetries, as shards can arbitrarily fail due to
Pipelines API Error 10
See https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/community/posts/360046714292.

3- Force the number of shards to be under 10,000 such that the workflow
doesn't create more than 50,000 nodes.
See https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/community/posts/360048098952.

Setting the `merge_count` to 3 results in 6,798 shards.
Without explicitly setting it, the merge_count is 2, resulting in 10,187.

4- Explicitly use a full-priced VM for SNPsVariantRecalibrator.
This is a single gating node for the next batch of sharded steps.
Prefer not to use preemptible VMs here.

5- Increase memory available for VariantRecalibrator.
For runs of around 4,000 samples, the 3g default memory was nowhere near
sufficient. With higher values, like 32g, this step finished reliably
and much more quickly (under 4 hrs).

6- Correct the path to gsutil for metrics gathering.
See https://github.com/gatk-workflows/gatk4-germline-snps-indels/issues/41.
